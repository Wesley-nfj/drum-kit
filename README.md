# 🥁 Simple Drum Kit

A basic interactive **Drum Kit** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can press keyboard keys (`A`, `S`, `D`, `F`) or click buttons to play drum sounds.  
All sounds are hosted via FreeCodeCamp's audio links.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for the layout and structure
- **CSS** – for styling and button animations
- **JavaScript** – for playing sounds and handling user interaction

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- Each drum button has a `data-key` attribute matching a keyboard key.
- When a key is pressed or a button is clicked:
  - A sound mapped to that key is played.
  - The button is briefly animated using the `.playing` CSS class.
